Amazon Web Services Proof of Concept and Prototypes
===================================================

This project has been motivated by a desire to test or examine the character of the AWS golang API, and in addition some of the features of AWS.

When employing tools within this project you will be services that are fee based services offered by Amazon.
Before running any tools within this package be sure you understand the financial implications of doing so.

This project is a personal discovery endeavor and should not be used to in way to imply the software architecture I am using personally, or in my professional capacity.  This project is simply a way for me to experiment with some of AWS APIs to validate and investigate their ease of use and the utility of various features.

The tools within this project have an expectation that the AWS credentials will be made available using the prototypical AWS environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.  Beware of the security implications of passing these environment variables around and never store them on github or in any other accessible location.

Finally be sure to read the license which I intended to be permissive so that you can freely use the code.

Have fun,
